      <description>This contains a list of questions I get asked through email or friends!  Disclaimer: This is based on my experience and should NOT be taken as official response!
  Are International Students eligible for ORISE (OakRidge Science) Fellowships ?  International students can apply to most ORISE fellowships (unless the position is only for US citizens). If accepted, you will be required to change your visa to J1 - long/short term research scholar depending on the length of the position.</description>
